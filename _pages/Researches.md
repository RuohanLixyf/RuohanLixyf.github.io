Map-Matching, Sep.2023 - Now
======
* As part of generating Complete Trip data, the map-matching method based on the HMM model is used to perform map matching on human Location-based Service (LBS) data, aligning human movement trajectories with a digital map, such as Open Street Map (OSM).

Intelligent quality detection of lane rendering data,Aug.2022- Sept.2022 
======
* Objective: To efficiently detect whether there are defects in the rendered generated map data for navigation
* Implemented pre-training with Masked Image Modeling using three hybrid CNN-LSTM neural network models
* Build the pre-training pipeline for the image recovery task and carried out the pre-training
* Tested different numbers of continuous sequence image inputs with different pre-training models
* Adjusted the pre-trained models for fine-tuning the image classification task
* Developed the pipeline for abnormal image detection to identify defected lane rendering image
* Delivery: An implementation report and participated in the HUAWEI 2022 Global AI Challenge

Research on ecological risk assessment and traffic carrying capacity of road areas in ecological function zones,Sep.2021 - Sep.2022
======
Lanzhou Jiaotong University | Research Assistant

* Objective: To study the impact of highway traffic on the surrounding environment, calculate the carrying capacity of traffic 
* Wrote the research proposal.
* Arranged the required instruments and equipment for the research (portable weather stations, noise detectors, etc.), tested and debug the equipment
* Led the research team for a 5-day field data collection. Collected data includes regular air pollution data, meteorological data, traffic data, soil heavy metal data, noise data, etc.
* Established a road traffic and ecological risk evaluation index system for ecological function areas
* Determined the scope of the environmental impact of the highway is 600 meters using remote sensing datas
* Delivery: Completed a research report, and prepared a project proposal for the National Natural Science Foundation of China
