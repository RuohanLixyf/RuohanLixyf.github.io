Map-Matching, Sep.2023 - Present

    <h2>Map Matching, Sep. 2023 – Present</h2>
    <p>
       I work on improving how we turn raw location-based service (LBS) data into clean and reliable human travel trajectories. Using a method based on Hidden Markov Models (HMM), I match each noisy GPS point to the most likely road on a digital map (such as OpenStreetMap).
    </p>
    <p>
      To make this process accurate and easy to use across different cities and datasets, I developed NovaMatch, a unified pipeline that automatically cleans LBS data, performs map matching, and produces high-quality, complete travel paths. NovaMatch is now used to generate our lab’s Complete Trip data for large-scale mobility analysis.
