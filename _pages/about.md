I am a Ph.D. Candidate and Graduate Research Assistant at the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, College of Engineering, [Villanova University](https://www1.villanova.edu/university.html), PA, USA. I am a member of the [Villanova Human Mobility Data Lab](https://cfxiong.github.io/data-lab/) (<span style="color:#0A2A66"><strong>Nova</strong></span><span style="color:#32B5FF"><strong>Mobility</strong></span>) supervised by [Dr. Chenfeng Xiong](https://cfxiong.github.io/). 

My research focuses on human mobility and large-scale location-based services (LBS) data, with an emphasis on understanding and reconstructing travel trajectories. I develop methods that make noisy movement data analytically usable, ranging from map matching and trajectory reconstruction to the structural modeling of mobility behavior. I am also interested in the broader mobility issues such as accessibility and transit demand–supply mismatches using empirical, high-resolution data.

My current work includes advancing map-matching algorithms for LBS data, particularly *NovaMatch*, a unified and extensible pipeline capable of matching diverse trajectory and sequence data, including LBS points, TMC paths, and probe traces, to a wide range of transportation networks, as well as developing trajectory modeling frameworks and assessing equity-related mobility outcomes. <span style="color:#32B5FF"> *If you are interested in my research, Feel free to contact me for research discussion and possible collaboration!* </span> 😄 🚀 ✨

<span style="color:#0A2A66">News</span> 
======
- **10/2025**: I will present my paper *Rethinking **Transit Deserts**: Identifying Pseudo and Real Gaps through Trip-Level Mobility Data* at the **TRB 105th Annual Meeting**, as the **first presenter** in **Lectern Session 4018: Evaluation of Non-Conventional Transit Impacts** <span style="color:#32B5FF"> (Wednesday, Jan 14, 8:00–9:45 AM, Room 150B, Convention Center)</span> . The session will be presided by William Wong (Federal Transit Administration).  
  Welcome to attend and join the discussion!
- **09/2025**: My paper *Rethinking Transit Deserts: Identifying Pseudo and Real Gaps through Trip-Level Mobility Data*  has been accepted by TRB. Another paper, *Complete Trip: An Open and Privacy-Safe Dataset of Multimodal Travel Sequences for Urban Transportation Systems Analysis*, has also been accepted. 
- **08/2025**: After the TRB deadline, I’ve been busy “cleaning up” my LBS map-matching code. 🧹 Formatting code so that *other humans* (including future me) can understand it feels like the hardest optimization problem ever. 🤯 *What on earth was I thinking when I wrote this?*  Now it just looks like a %￥%#@@ ……#…………, completely frazzled... 😵‍💫🔥
- **09/2024**: The Computer Software Copyright Registration in China: Vision-Based Lane Detection System With Self-supervised Pre-training Through Masked Sequential Auto-encoders (VLD_SP-MSAE), granted on Sep. 11, 2024, Patent number 2024R11L1180902. And we have published our [open source Lane Detection Code](https://github.com/RuohanLixyf/Lane-Detection-Self-Supervised-MSAE) on GitHub, including models and dataset.
- **09/2024**: I present my recent work: Sup-HMM Map-Matching of Location Data Trajectories: A Heterogeneous and Bayesian-Optimized Hidden Markov Approach at TRC-30 conference. A nice trip on Crete.
- **07/2024**: My paper have been submitted and is currently under review by [The Transportation Research Board (TRB) 104nd Annual Meeting](https://trb-annual-meeting.nationalacademies.org/): Sup-HMM Map-Matching of Location Data Trajectories: A Heterogeneous and Bayesian-Optimized Hidden Markov Approach. Working on the map-matching continues. This work is part of our team's Complete Trips Project.
