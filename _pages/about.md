I am a Ph.D. Student and Graduate Research Assistant at the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, College of Engineering, [Villanova University](https://www1.villanova.edu/university.html), PA, USA. I am the member of the [Villanova Human Mobility Data Lab (NovaMobility)](https://cfxiong.github.io/data-lab/) supervised by [Dr. Chenfeng Xiong](https://cfxiong.github.io/). I am passionate about everything related to transportation and various advanced applications that are technology-oriented. I care about cutting-edge technological applications in transportation, such as map-matching for human travel trajectories and lane detection in autonomous driving. I also focus on the environmental impact of transportation, such as the effect of vehicle-generated air pollutants on road areas. Currently, I am mainly involved in the generation and processing of human mobility data, with a primary focus on the application of map-matching technology in human mobility data. I am passionate about applying the latest technologies, such as machine learning, deep learning, reinforcement learning, and various software and tools, to address transportation issues.

News 
======
- **05/2025**: Finally... my ancient graduate research paper, *A CFD-Based Integrated Modeling Framework for Assessing Highway Traffic Capacity under Regional Air Quality Constraints*, got accepted by *[Sustainability](https://www.mdpi.com/journal/sustainability)* in May 2025. This paper presents a CFD-based framework to evaluate how regional air quality constraints affect highway traffic capacity. Started back in my master's days, survived the revisions, and now it lives. and finally accepted ‚Äî what a relief üòÆ‚Äçüí®ü´†.
  
- **09/2024**: The Computer Software Copyright Registration in China: Vision-Based Lane Detection System With Self-supervised Pre-training Through Masked Sequential Auto-encoders (VLD_SP-MSAE), granted on Sep. 11, 2024, Patent number 2024R11L1180902. And we have published our [open source Lane Detection Code](https://github.com/RuohanLixyf/Lane-Detection-Self-Supervised-MSAE) on GitHub, including models and dataset.
  
- **09/2024**: I present my recent work: Sup-HMM Map-Matching of Location Data Trajectories: A Heterogeneous and Bayesian-Optimized Hidden Markov Approach at TRC-30 conference. A nice trip on Crete.
  
- **08/2024**: Finally rearranged part of my graduate thesis and submitted it to [Atmospheric Pollution Research](https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/atmospheric-pollution-research): A Novel Highway Traffic Capacity Analysis Method under Road Region Atmospheric Environment Constraints Based on a Computational Fluid Dynamics Model.
  
- **07/2024**: My paper have been submitted and is currently under review by [The Transportation Research Board (TRB) 104nd Annual Meeting](https://trb-annual-meeting.nationalacademies.org/): Sup-HMM Map-Matching of Location Data Trajectories: A Heterogeneous and Bayesian-Optimized Hidden Markov Approach. Working on the map-matching continues. This work is part of our team's Complete Trips Project.
