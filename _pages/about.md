I am a Ph.D. Candidate and Graduate Research Assistant at the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, College of Engineering, [Villanova University](https://www1.villanova.edu/university.html), PA, USA. I am the member of the [Villanova Human Mobility Data Lab (NovaMobility)](https://cfxiong.github.io/data-lab/) supervised by [Dr. Chenfeng Xiong](https://cfxiong.github.io/). 
My research centers on human mobility, large-scale location-based services (LBS) data, and the modeling, interpretation, and reconstruction of travel trajectories. I work at the intersection of data-driven mobility analytics and computational modeling, with a strong focus on map matching, trajectory structures, and the methodological foundations required to make sense of noisy, high-resolution movement data. Beyond trajectory analysis, I am also interested in the broader implications of mobility systems, including environmental impacts, urban accessibility, and demand-supply mismatches in transit systems, especially when these issues can be quantified through large-scale empirical data. Across my work, I aim to integrate machine learning, probabilistic modeling, and deep learning with principled, interpretable frameworks for understanding mobility behavior. 
My current projects include developing new map-matching algorithms for LBS data, particularly NovaMatch, a unified and extensible pipeline for matching any form of trajectory data to networks, advancing trajectory modeling theories, and evaluating mobility-based environmental and equity outcomes.

News 
======
- **10/2025**: I will present my paper *Rethinking Transit Deserts: Identifying Pseudo and Real Gaps through Trip-Level Mobility Data* at the **TRB 105th Annual Meeting**, as the **first presenter** in **Lectern Session 4018: Evaluation of Non-Conventional Transit Impacts** (Wednesday, Jan 14, 8:00–9:45 AM, Room 150B, Convention Center). The session will be presided by William Wong (Federal Transit Administration).  
  Welcome to attend and join the discussion!
- **09/2025**: My paper *Rethinking Transit Deserts: Identifying Pseudo and Real Gaps through Trip-Level Mobility Data*  has been accepted by TRB. Another paper, *Complete Trip: An Open and Privacy-Safe Dataset of Multimodal Travel Sequences for Urban Transportation Systems Analysis*, has also been accepted. 
- **08/2025**: After the TRB deadline, I’ve been busy “cleaning up” my LBS map-matching code. 🧹 Formatting code so that *other humans* (including future me) can understand it feels like the hardest optimization problem ever. 🤯 *What on earth was I thinking when I wrote this?*  Now it just looks like a %￥%#@@ ……#…………, completely frazzled... 😵‍💫🔥
  
- **05/2025**: Finally... my ancient graduate research paper, *A CFD-Based Integrated Modeling Framework for Assessing Highway Traffic Capacity under Regional Air Quality Constraints*, got accepted by *[Sustainability](https://www.mdpi.com/journal/sustainability)* in May 2025. This paper presents a CFD-based framework to evaluate how regional air quality constraints affect highway traffic capacity. Started back in my master's days, survived the revisions, and now it lives — what a relief 😮‍💨🫠.
  
- **09/2024**: The Computer Software Copyright Registration in China: Vision-Based Lane Detection System With Self-supervised Pre-training Through Masked Sequential Auto-encoders (VLD_SP-MSAE), granted on Sep. 11, 2024, Patent number 2024R11L1180902. And we have published our [open source Lane Detection Code](https://github.com/RuohanLixyf/Lane-Detection-Self-Supervised-MSAE) on GitHub, including models and dataset.
  
- **09/2024**: I present my recent work: Sup-HMM Map-Matching of Location Data Trajectories: A Heterogeneous and Bayesian-Optimized Hidden Markov Approach at TRC-30 conference. A nice trip on Crete.
  
- **08/2024**: Finally rearranged part of my graduate thesis and submitted it to [Atmospheric Pollution Research](https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/atmospheric-pollution-research): A Novel Highway Traffic Capacity Analysis Method under Road Region Atmospheric Environment Constraints Based on a Computational Fluid Dynamics Model.
  
- **07/2024**: My paper have been submitted and is currently under review by [The Transportation Research Board (TRB) 104nd Annual Meeting](https://trb-annual-meeting.nationalacademies.org/): Sup-HMM Map-Matching of Location Data Trajectories: A Heterogeneous and Bayesian-Optimized Hidden Markov Approach. Working on the map-matching continues. This work is part of our team's Complete Trips Project.
